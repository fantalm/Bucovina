On the landing page we have the hero image, a photo of a valley in Bucovina covered in fog. I chose this photo because it is emblematic for the beatifull landscapes of Bucovina and so it supports the purpose of the website. For this reason and for consistency I chose to display this image on all 5 pages of the website.
Right below the hero image we have the navigation bar.
