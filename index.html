                <h2> A bit about Bucovina</h2>
                <p> Bucovina is one of the most beautiful Carpathian provinces, it is a fascinating land rich in history, with amazing people, 
                    and landscapes that will leave you breathless</p>

                <p> Seen on the map, the historical region of Bucovina covers the cities of Suceava, 
                    Câmpulung Moldovenesc, Rădăuţi, Siret and Vicovu de Sus as well as the central and western part of the Chernivtsi region in Ukraine.
                    Rich in both culture and amazing landscapes, Bucovina is also emblematic through 
                    the hospitality and warmth of the people that have so much respect for nature. </p>

                </div>
                <p> The Land of Beech trees, as it was also called, has done a good job in preserving some unique spiritual and material values due to their specificity.
                    Bucovina is appreciated for the numerous monasteries built by former rulers such as Stefan the Great, Alexandru the Good, Petru Rares 
                    and Alexandru Lapusneanu.</p><br>
